# Callsign Lookup Tool

This project provides a web service for looking up Malaysian ham radio callsigns. It includes a Flask-based server and a bash script to fetch and process data from the MCMC website.

## Features

- **Flask Web Service**: Serves an HTML page for user interaction.
- **Bash Script**: Fetches data from the MCMC website, processes it, and provides it in a formatted JSON response.

## Project Structure

├── server.py              # Flask server script

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/callsign.git
   cd callsign
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**

   Ensure `callsign.sh` is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x callsign.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Flask Server

To start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` and `http://<your-ip>:5000`.

### Using the Callsign Lookup Tool

1. **Access the Web Page**

   Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the search form.

2. **Search for a Callsign**

   Enter a callsign in the search form and submit. The server will fetch and display the data for the specified callsign.

### Testing the API with Curl

To test the API directly using curl:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/callsign?callsign=YOUR_CALLSIGN"
```

Replace `YOUR_CALLSIGN` with the callsign you want to look up.

## Notes

- The script `callsign.sh` handles the data retrieval and formatting. It cleans up temporary files after processing.
- Ensure the MCMC website structure hasn’t changed, as this might affect the data extraction process.
